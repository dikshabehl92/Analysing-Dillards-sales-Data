Analysing Dillards sales Data to study customer purchasing patterns

As part of this mini project, I translated analysis questions into SQL queries.

Analysis Question: What factors affect customer purchasing at Dillards

I created a structured Pyramid Analysis Plan to understand the computations behind the factors explored. Below mentioned are the analyses I did -
1. Analyze sales trends across stores and months to determine if there are specific stores, departments, or times of year that are associated with better or worse sales performance.
2. Whether the characteristics of the geographic location in which a store resides correlates with the sales performance of the store.
3. Analyzing monthly (or seasonal) sales effects

Due to confidentiality purposes, I won't be able to share the data. I'll post my queries along with descriptions of what I tried to do with the query.
